        <h2>The localStorage</h2>
        <p>
          The localStorage object stores the data with no expiration date. The
          data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be
          available the next day, week, or year.
        </p>
        <h2>The sessionStorage</h2>
        <p>
          The sessionStorage object is equal to the localStorage object, except
          that it stores the data for only one session. The data is deleted when
          the user closes the specific browser tab.

        <h2>Block Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function
          Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and
          const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
          Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript
          program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar
          when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope:
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="undefined">
        <h2>undefined</h2>
        <p>
          The global undefined property represents the primitive value
          undefined. It is one of JavaScript's primitive types. undefined is a
          property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global
          scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value
          undefined. In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a
          non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the
          case, avoid overriding it.) A variable that has not been assigned a
          value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
          undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an
          assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not
          returned.
        </p>

      <article id="event-loop">
        <h2>The event loop</h2>
        <p>
          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
          Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take
          the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
          which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
          Event Loop. JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop,
          which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing
          events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different
          from models in other languages like C and Java.
