    <main>
      <section id="storage">
        <h2>The localStorage</h2>
        <p>
          The localStorage object stores the data with no expiration date. The
          data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be
          available the next day, week, or year.
        </p>
        <h2>The sessionStorage</h2>
        <p>
          The sessionStorage object is equal to the localStorage object, except
          that it stores the data for only one session. The data is deleted when
          the user closes the specific browser tab.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="scope">
        <h2>Block Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function
          Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and
          const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
